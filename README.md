#Autonomous Mobile Robot Welder
Autonomous welding with a UR5 robot manipulator using ROS, MoveIt!, and Gazebo. Microsoft Kinect was used for
obtaining depth image, which was integrated with ROS using ‘openni_kinect’. OpenCV was used for extracting way-point from
cracks using K-nn, which were given to MoveIt! for motion planning and obstacle avoidance. URDF files were created for Gazebo to
recreate the whole process in simulation.
